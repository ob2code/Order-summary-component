## My process

### Built with

- Plain CSS & HTML
- BEM methodology
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Draw out the layout before getting started with coding, break the layout to the smallest components and also check if they need a container or wrapper.

Try to think about components that can be reusable as BEM applying (seems difficult for me at first üôÑ)

```html
<div class="card__content">
  <h1 class="card__content__title">Order Summary</h1>
  <p class="card__content__desc">You can now listen to millions of songs, audiobooks, and podcasts on any device anywhere you like!</p>
  ......
</div>
```
Using filter to brightness effect when hover

```css
.btn--blue:hover {
  filter: var(--brightness);
}
```
